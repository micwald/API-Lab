# API TIL WE DIE

This project was made practising jQuery by making smaller changes with an already existing project and there after also understanding the code. Especially the jQuery code.

## What the project does

It's a progress bar styled with css to showcase our projects and to give a small introduction to jQuery.

## Why the project is useful for interaction design

The progress bar is a visual representation of where you are and that could be valuable when your e.g. presenting something or signing a form.
