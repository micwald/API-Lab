A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/johnblazek/pen/nceyw.

 Wanted to explore some 3d carousel goodness, using DOM elements. Works best in Chrome/Safari, then FF, not 100% sure about IE 10.

TO DO: Adding touch interaction with devices & animate into place and out.

NOTE: 5/29/17 -This looks different. This pen is really old and since the move from http:// to https:// i've lost some references to fonts and images and whatnot. working to get that re-established. Until then, you get the point of it!
