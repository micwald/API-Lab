# API Maze

This project was made practising jQuery by making smaller changes with an already existing project and there after also understanding the code. Especially the jQuery code.

## What the project does

It's an amazing maze game with different difficulties.

## Why the project is useful for interaction design

The code could e.g. be used to different projects/games where you want to create obstacles for the user and also count the "steps" a user takes.
